# kickstarter_analysis
The purpose of this analysis to provide Louise enough information to support her strategy to fund her upcoming production. The source of the data was our kickstarter data. We analyzed the launch dates across the year for 1066 PLAYS, which indicate a high peak for May and June; we also assessed the goals set for all 4064 projects, providing the visual representation across the goal ranges and their outcomes, such numbers indicate that 58% of all campaigns launched have failed, 23% canceled and 19 were successfully funded. Providing Louise the trend of the goal, based on the length of the campaign would've been a good supporting statistic.
